# Json-Based-Inventory-Management-System-Project
During my internship in ETG i have Implemented json based inventory management system using Python Programming Language in guidance of Ashish Jhangra Sir.
First I took product details in Dictionary Format as product_id , Product_Name , Quantity ,Brand , Flavour,Price and then Dumped this dictionary into Json Format.
Then I performed Many Operations as Reading The Product , Adding The Product , Purchasing the product , Billing Amount For Product , Updating Product Details after Purchasing.
